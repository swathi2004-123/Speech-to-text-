Project: Real-Time Speech Recognition Transcription (SRT) / Customer Support Automation System

Overview:

This project implements a real-time speech transcription system tailored for automating customer support conversations. It listens to user queries through a microphone, transcribes speech to text in real time, and can be integrated with support bots or CRMs. This reduces human workload and improves response efficiency in support operations.

Technologies Used:

Python 3.8+

speech_recognition – Real-time ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)

pyaudio or sounddevice – Live microphone input

noisereduce – Optional noise suppression

jiwer – (Optional) Evaluation using Word Error Rate

Optional: whisper, wav2vec2, or other pretrained models for high accuracy



---

Installation:

pip install speechrecognition pyaudio noisereduce jiwer

Note: On some systems, you may need portaudio:

# For Linux
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev

# For Mac
brew install portaudio

Usage:

1. Run the script:

python real_time_support.py


2. Speak into your microphone.


3. The system will transcribe your input in real time.



Example Output:

Customer Support Transcription System
Say something... (Press Ctrl+C to stop)

Listening...
Transcribing...
Customer Said: I need help with resetting my password
--------------------------------------

Conclusion:

This real-time transcription system enables scalable customer support by accurately capturing user speech and converting it into actionable text. It serves as a foundation for chatbots, call centers, and virtual assistants. Further integration with NLP services or databases can automate ticket creation, FAQs, and more.
